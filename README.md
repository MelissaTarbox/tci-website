# tci-website
code files for tci website 2016
The code files (HTML & CSS) I used to completely redisgn/code the Tarbox Construction, Inc. website. 
I used Bootstrap to create this website. Specifically the "Carousel" Custome Component for the landing page, and the basic nav bar for the remaining pages.
